# The LoSSETT ancillaries repo

This repository contains ancillary scripts to aid in the running of LoSSETT (https://github.com/ElliotMG/LoSSETT), preprocessing and visualisation of outputs.

## Repository Structure

Within `src`:

* `lossett_control/control` contains Python and Bash scripts for orchestrating the execution of LoSSETT workflows, including on test data.
* `lossett_control/preprocessing` contains Python scripts for pre-processing data to match the specific cases in `lossett_control/control`.
* `lossett_plotting` contains various example plotting Python scripts and iPython notebooks.

## Prerequisites
Current distribution of python (Python 3) - built with `xarray` and `numpy`. See `pyproject.toml` for full list of requirements. You must have LoSSETT (https://github.com/ElliotMG/LoSSETT) installed to make use of any of the run scripts.

## Installation

As a user: activate a suitable environment then pip install:

```bash
pip install  git+https://github.com/ElliotMG/LoSSETT_ANCIL.git
```

As a developer: fork then clone the repository (please create a branch before making any changes!), activate a suitable Python environment, navigate to your LoSSETT directory and

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This will install as the user installation but using the editable cloned code. Please commit code improvements and discuss merging with the master branch with Elliot McKinnon-Gray, Dan Shipley, and other users.
